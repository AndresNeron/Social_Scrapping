As an example:
	In week 1: 50 follows/unfollows per day
	In week 2: 100 follows/unfollows per day
	In week 3: 150 follows/unfollows per day

You need to keep those under 12-14 an hour, with a 350 â€“ 400 second break between each one.

When liking posts, make sure you like posts from the accounts you follow; otherwise, you increase the chance of getting banned.
